 * The load function -- call this to start the cog.
 * We put this here so that this .cog file can be pulled in from a
 * library. If you're not using libraries it doesn't matter where it
 * goes. The reason we need it for a library (.a) is subtle; the linker
 * will only add a .cog file from a library if some symbol from the .cog
 * is actually used, so we need to provide something that the main
 * program references (the __load_start_XXX_cog symbol will not work, because
 * the linker only creates that *after* it has decided it needs the .cog!)
 *
 * the "toggle_fw_code" label serves this purpose; the caller should
 * use this instead of _load_start_toggle_fw_cog[]. This is necessary
 * because the linker does not define _load_start_XXX until *after* all
 * linking decisions are made, so that symbol cannot be used to force
 * this module to be linked; we need some symbol that is already present
 * in the .cog file.
